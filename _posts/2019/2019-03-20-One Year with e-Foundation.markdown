I am **Amit Kumar** and I have been working with [/e/ Foundation](https://e.foundation) since last year. It’s a non-profit project for the public by the public (open source). It’s been a great experience working with /e/ people from different countries which I would like to describe here.


# How I come to know /e/ Foundation (previously Eelo)?
Once I was talking with my friends and we were discussing the Syria and Yemen crisis. We discussed it for 2–3 hours in night but I strongly remembered that neither I or my friend searched anything about it on Internet at that time nor watched any video on Youtube. But to my utter surprise, next morning when I opened **Youtube**, I just saw a video in my recommendations related to Syrian Crisis. I was thinking that maybe I have searched about it so I decided to check my history but there is no instance related to that (neither in Youtube nor in google my-activity). I realised that my phone mic was listening to my conversations and literally listens everything I say (as far as I have discovered so far).

Then, It was about **January’2018** when one person also shared the same experience. At that time, I come to know how companies like **Google** and **Apple** track every single data that goes into or come out from phone, PC or any other device which uses some OS or service from these companies. And the more unhappy thing for me was that these data is shared with third parties without giving a clear indication to the users. <u>From my location to my voice search, from my web search to my hotel booking, From my emails to my drive storage, Everything was being used by these companies</u>. As a regular user of these services, I used <u>gmail, google drive, google maps, google photos, google voice or literally anything</u> which google provides. Although it doesn’t directly seems a serious concern to a normal user but the kind of manipulation it can do to your thought process is something which everybody should understand.

So going through all the above experience, Initially I thought to compile my own ROM and remove all such stuffs from that like Google Apps and disable all such permissions or sensors by default (so that my mic won’t hear me again). I started using **Mozilla** and setup my own sync server on my local machine (because I didn’t want to use any cloud server or such service provider). I started to watch youtube videos in **incognito mode** because I don’t want to see the same result in my feeds just to suffer from only one type of bias. For my phone, I started using **LineageOS** with a very minimal set of Google Apps (needed as to use services like Uber and other apps). I was a noob with ROM compilation and completely ungoogling it was a tough task for me. So I started to look for </u>meaningful alternative that provides real solution to such data slavery</u>. I came across one such thing then known as **EELO** now know as /e/. Eelo promises to create a safe and privacy oriented enviornment for people and gives freedom from data slavery.

# What is /e/ (or Eelo)?
> <u>/e/ is a non-profit project</u>, in the public interest. We build open-source mobile operating systems that respect users’ data privacy. We’re an international core team of experienced entrepreneurs, developers and designers, and a growing community of contributors.

/e/ is started by **Gaël Duval**, the man who created the successful Mandrake Linux. After launching the crowdfunding campaign, a large number of supporters from different countries came to the front to support such initiative. You can read more about it [here](https://e.foundation/about-e/) or you can read articles written by Duval on [Medium](https://hackernoon.com/leaving-apple-and-google-my-eelo-odyssey-introduction-d22741f990d7).

# How I joined /e/?
Once I looked about /e/, I was desperately waiting to use it but as It was just started it was not ready to use. I saw that Gaël Duval was looking for developers. I am an **Android Developer** so I instantly decided to drop a mail and I did. I received a reply from Gaël Duval and then I started to work with /e/.

# Experience

It’s been a year since I started to work /e/ and I can say for sure, It’s really a very great experience. Core team consists of people from different countries. Few of them are from my home country (India). The most inspiring person in the team is **Gaël Duval**. The kind of knowledge and understanding level he has is very amazing to me. He just keeps on going things and tries to make them easy for the development team to achieve the goals. Every people in team is very helpful and like to share knowledge and skills. **Romain Hunault** helps me very much with day to day git issues and build server configuration. Overall, I feel very grateful to work with such wonderful team.
