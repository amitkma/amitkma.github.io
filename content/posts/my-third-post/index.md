## Introduction

:wave: Hello World!, I am Amit Kumar, Founder, Software Developer, Finance Enthusiast and responsible for just everything on this website. Here, you can find my views related to anything. All the content or view shared here are my own. Anyway, who cares what I write :grinning:.

After graduating from [IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/) in Electronics and Communication Engineering, I joined a french company [Murena](https://murena.com/) which specializes in building pro-privacy smartphones. I worked as Android Developer and built the face of the OS. Also known as BlissLauncher. 

I also spent some time at [Stream](https://getstream.io/) and worked on the Chat SDK. I also worked on [Element](https://element.io/) mobile app which is an instant messenger based on decentralized [Matrix Protocol](https://matrix.org/).

Currently, I am the co-founder of [DotMyStyle](https://dotmystyle.com). DotMyStyle is on a mission to change the fashion retail landscape in India by building e-commerce 3.0.
